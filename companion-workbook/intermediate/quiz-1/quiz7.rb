limit = 15

def fib(first_num, second_num)
  while second_num < limit
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
    second_num = sum
  end

result = fib(0, 1)
puts "result is #{result}"

# Solution:
# limit variable is defined out of method scope. 

# How would you fix this so that it works?
# Add limit as parameter

  while second_num < limit
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
